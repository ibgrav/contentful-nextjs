# Hard Problems

1. Dynamic Routes (/item/article-slug)
2. Select and manage design system components
3. Configure authentication on a page
   - Authenticate from the server-side (JWT)
4. Query secure API
   - https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/events/reunions/Pages/default.aspx
5. Subsites with unique top navigation (https://www.hbs.edu/about/annualreport/2021)
6. Query component, e.g.
   - First two items are manually selected
   - Last item is a specific article type
